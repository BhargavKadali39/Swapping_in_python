# Swapping_in_python

Swapping is the most common this in logic designing.
swapping in the OG's book.

    x = 10
    y = 20
    
    temp = x
    x = y
    y = temp
    print(x,y)
    
    Output: 20 10

I agree that the old swapping technique works everytime,but it also increases the amount of code required.
So let's learn some new swapping tricks.

Before going into the context lemme tell you the advantage of them,
* Integrate it into your code makes less instances required.
* Improves logical thanking.
* Less wastage of resources.
